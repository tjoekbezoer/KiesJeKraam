# "Kies je kraam" algorithm

This is the code for the algorithm I developed for the city of Amsterdam. The code is complete getting it to run from this repository will be a challenge, as it is distilled from a larger body of code. This repository exists solely for demonstration puposes.

The entry point is `index.tsx`, the algorithmic logic can be found in `algo`, and the input/output data definitions can be found in `models`.
